TODO:
  - add wasd to cube moverss
  - pre-compile stylesheets
  - Make slight alterations to oscillation values (speed it up to see where its shitty)
  - Find clever way to reset cube position (re: oscillation) when project tiles unfolded

Notes:
  - 'Sides' and their css represent the physical squares that make up the different sides. Any transitions to them should happen at the 'side' level. 'Faces' are the 2d representation of content that lays on the sides. Sides are the wrappers to the faces.
